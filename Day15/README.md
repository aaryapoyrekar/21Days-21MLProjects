# 🗣️ Talk to Your Data  
## Project 15: Text-to-SQL via Prompt Engineering

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Text-to-SQL (Natural Language to SQL)** system that allows users to query an **e-commerce database** using plain English. The system converts natural language questions into valid **SQLite SQL queries** using **prompt engineering** and **Google Gemini**, executes them on the database, and returns structured results.

---

## 🎯 What This Project Does

- Accepts user questions in natural language  
- Converts them into executable SQL queries  
- Executes queries on a real SQLite database  
- Returns results as structured tables  
- Supports joins, filtering, aggregation, ranking, and sorting

## ⚙️ How It Works

User Question → Prompt Engine → Gemini AI → SQL Query → SQLite → Results

## 🔍 Example Queries

- What are my most popular products?
- Show me the order count by country.
- Which country ranks in the middle by total sales?
- What is the 2nd highest sold product for each country?
- On which day of the week do I get the most orders?
